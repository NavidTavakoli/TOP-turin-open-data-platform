## About the Project

**Turin Open Data Platform (TOP)** is a real-world prototype of a **smart city KPI dashboard**. It is a project designed to demonstrate how **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** can empower smart cities. By collecting, cleaning, and visualizing near real-time data from multiple sources, this platform provides valuable insights into the urban environment of **Turin, Italy**.

The platform integrates diverse datasets‚Äîincluding **weather**, **air quality**, **traffic conditions**, and even **citizen opinions from Reddit**‚Äîto build a unified city dashboard. The goal is to highlight how open data and automation can support decision-making, sustainability, and better quality of life in modern urban ecosystems and smart cities.

## üåç Data Sources

The platform integrates multiple APIs into a single PostgreSQL database hosted on **Supabase**:

- **üå¶Ô∏è Weather (Open-Meteo API)**
   Current meteorological conditions for Turin (temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, etc.).
- **üè≠ Air Quality (WAQI API ‚Äì Lingotto station)**
   Near air quality index (AQI) and pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, O‚ÇÉ, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ.
- **üö¶ Traffic Flow (5T Piemonte API)**
   Road speed and flow indicators across the Piemonte region, categorized into congestion levels (free, moderate, busy, heavy, jam).
- **üí¨ Reddit /r/Torino**
   The last 50 posts from the local Reddit community.



## ‚ú® Features

- üå¶ **Weather Data** ‚Äì Fetches real-time weather information for Turin.
- üå´ **Air Quality Monitoring** ‚Äì Tracks pollution and atmospheric conditions across the city.
- üö¶ **Traffic Data** ‚Äì Collects mobility and congestion information from the Piedmont region.
- üí¨ **Citizen Voices** ‚Äì Gathers the latest Reddit posts about Turin to reflect community sentiment.
- ‚ö° **Automated Data Pipeline** ‚Äì Uses **GitHub Actions** to fetch, clean, and load data into a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database (**Supabase**).
- üìä **Real-Time Dashboard** ‚Äì Interactive city dashboard that visualizes KPIs for Turin in near real-time.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation with GitHub Actions

All data collection and maintenance tasks are fully automated using **GitHub Actions**, scheduled via CRON.
 Workflows are located under `.github/workflows`:

- **`cron-etl.yml`** ‚Üí ETL pipelines that fetch data from external APIs and insert them into Supabase.
- **`cron-rollup.yml`** ‚Üí Weekly rollup & cleanup for weather data.
- **`cron-purge-traffic.yml`** ‚Üí Bi-daily purge of old traffic data to keep the database lean.
- **`cron-reddit.yml`** ‚Üí Fetches and stores the latest 50 community posts every 3 hours.

These pipelines ensure that the database remains **fresh, lightweight, and near real-time oriented**.



## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** hosts the structured tables (`weather_current`, `air_quality_current`, `traffic_flow_current`, `reddit_torino_posts`).

- **Views** provide higher-level KPIs (e.g., city-wide traffic congestion summary).

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** + policies ensure that external clients can only **read** public-facing data.

  

## üñ• City Dashboard

The [City Dashboard](https://navidtavakolishalmani.com/city-dashboard )  presents all integrated datasets in a user-friendly, graphical format.

- Weather and air quality indexes update in real-time.
- Traffic congestion is tracked continuously.
- Reddit feeds showcase live community perspectives.

This dashboard illustrates how **data-driven insights** can help policymakers, researchers, and citizens better understand urban dynamics.



## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Backend / Data Pipeline**: GitHub Actions, Python, APIs
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: Web-based City Dashboard (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Charts)
- **Visualization**: Graphs & real-time charts for KPIs

## üåç Why This Project Matters

This project showcases the **importance of KPIs** in smart cities:

- Monitoring **environmental health** (air & weather).
- Managing **urban mobility** (traffic).
- Understanding **citizen engagement** (social media).
- Creating **data transparency** and **evidence-based policies**.

By automating open data collection and presenting it through a clear dashboard, **TOP** can inspire scalable applications for other cities worldwide.



## üéØ Next Steps

- Add KPIs for **energy consumption and renewables** (Terna).
- Integrate **public transport real-time** (GTT GTFS-RT).
- Explore **social sentiment analysis** from Reddit posts.
- Expand dashboard visualizations (pie charts, heatmaps, congestion maps).
